JDBC Sample
===========

A sample program to test Rocket's JDBC Driver for UniVerse/UniData.

This demo requires Java 6 or greater.

Ensure that both the JDBC driver and UOJ libraries are in your Java class path.

As an example for Windows:
    set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;c:\u2\unidk\uojsdk\lib\asjava.zip;c:\u2\unidk\jdbc\lib\unijdbc.jar

You may need to ensure the files and dictionaries referenced in the program exist in the account
you elect to connected to.
