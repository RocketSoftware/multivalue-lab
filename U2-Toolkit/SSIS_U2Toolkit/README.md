## Business Intelligence Development Studio (SSIS) and U2 Toolkit for .NET v.2.1.0 ##

Business Intelligence Development Studio is the environment that you will use to develop packages for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) in Integration Services (SSIS). SSIS includes graphical tools and wizards for building and debugging packages; tasks for performing workflow functions such as FTP operations, executing SQL statements, and sending e-mail messages; data sources and destinations for extracting and loading data; transformations for cleaning, aggregating, merging, and copying data; a management service, the Integration Services service for administering package execution and storage; and application programming interfaces (APIs) for programming the Integration Services object model.
