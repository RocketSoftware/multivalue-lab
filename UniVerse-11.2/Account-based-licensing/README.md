## Account-based licensing

Allocate and manage the license allotments for each account individually so you can ensure that all of the accounts get their fair share of licenses.

You can also group accounts together into logical groups for allocation of licenses.

'acct_licn.def' is an example file to get you started. Get sure to check out the manual for more information.
